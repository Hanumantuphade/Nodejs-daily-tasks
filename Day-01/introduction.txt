//1)nodeJS :-

//- Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run javaScript outside the browsesr, on the server.
// - built on chrome’s V8 engine-super fast in executing js 
// - it is event driven, non-blocking, and asynchronous
// - it uses a single-threaded model with event looping
// - it is open source and cross-platform
// - it is used for building scalable network applications
// - it has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available through npm (Node Package Manager)
// - it is widely used for building web servers, APIs, and real-time applications

//2)FUNDAMENTALS OF Node.js :-

// - Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which means that it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of other code.

// i)data types :-

// - Node.js supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, and null/undefined.
// - It also supports Buffer objects for handling binary data.

// ii)variables :-
// - Variables in Node.js can be declared using var, let, or const keywords.
// - var is function-scoped, let and const are block-scoped.
// - const is used for variables that should not be reassigned.

// iii)operators :-

// - Node.js supports various operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.
// - It also supports the ternary operator for conditional expressions.
// - Operators can be used to perform operations on variables and values.
// - Node.js also supports the spread operator (...) for expanding arrays and objects.
// - It also supports destructuring assignment for extracting values from arrays and objects.

// •	Arithmetic:   [ +, -, *, /, % ]
// •	Comparison: [ ==, ===, !=, !==, >, < ]
// •	Logical:         [ &&, ||, ! ]
// •	Assignment:  [ =, +=, -=, etc. ]



// iv)control structures :-

// - Node.js supports control structures like if-else statements, switch statements, and loops (for, while, do-while).
// - These structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your code based on conditions or iterations.
// - Node.js also supports the for...in and for...of loops for iterating over objects and arrays, respectively.
// - It also supports the try-catch statement for handling exceptions and errors in your code.

// Arrays in Node.js :-
// - Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
// - They can hold elements of any data type, including other arrays and objects.
// - Arrays can be created using the array literal syntax [] or the Array constructor.
// - Node.js provides various array methods for manipulating arrays, such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), slice(), and forEach().
// - Arrays can also be iterated using loops or the forEach() method.
// - Node.js supports array destructuring for extracting values from arrays into variables.

// v)objects :-
// - Objects in Node.js are used to store key-value pairs.
// - They can hold properties and methods, making them versatile for representing complex data structures.
// - Objects can be created using the object literal syntax {} or the Object constructor.
// - Node.js provides various methods for manipulating objects, such as Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().
// - Objects can also be iterated using for...in loops or Object.keys().
// - Node.js supports object destructuring for extracting values from objects into variables.


// vi)functions :-
// - Functions in Node.js are blocks of reusable code that can be called with arguments and return values.
// - They can be declared using the function keyword or as arrow functions.
// - Functions can accept parameters and return values, allowing for modular and organized code.
// - Node.js supports higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments or return functions
// - Functions can also be used as callbacks, allowing for asynchronous programming.
// - Node.js supports the concept of closures, where a function retains access to its outer scope even after it has been executed.
// - Functions can be defined as named functions or anonymous functions.



//vii)Asynchronous JavaScript Coding:-
// - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing for asynchronous programming.
// - Asynchronous code execution allows Node.js to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the event loop.
// - Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when the operation is complete.
// - Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation
// and allow for chaining of operations.
// - Async/await is a syntax that allows for writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.
// - Node.js provides various built-in modules for handling asynchronous operations, such as the fs module for file system operations and the http module for creating web servers.
