# 🟩 Node.js Daily Tasks

> **My journey to mastering Node.js by building one task per day.**

## 📅 About This Repo

This repository is a collection of my **daily Node.js learning tasks**, built while studying backend development with JavaScript.  
Every day, I complete a new mini-project or exercise using core Node.js and common backend tools.  
The goal is to build strong backend fundamentals, understand real-world use cases, and improve my coding consistency.

## 🚀 Goals

- 📘 Learn Node.js concepts hands-on  
- 🔁 Practice coding daily  
- 🔧 Work with modules, file system, HTTP, Express, etc.  
- 📂 Track progress publicly on GitHub  
- 📚 Build a personal reference of examples
