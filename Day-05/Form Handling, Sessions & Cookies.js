// Form Handling :-

//-	when a user submits a doem (like login or contact), the server needs to receive and process the form data.
//-	Express.js provides middleware like `express.urlencoded()` to parse URL-encoded data and `express.json()` for JSON data.


// cookies :-
//-	cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side by the browser.
//-	They are used to remember user preferences, sessions, and other information.
//-	Express.js provides the `cookie-parser` middleware to handle cookies easily.

// Sessions :-
//-	sessions are used to store user-specific data on the server-side.
//-	They are often used for authentication and maintaining user state.
